# Sprite Editor
A sprite editor written in QT.

## Naming conventions
Branches shall be named similary to the task they are created.  For example, the ActionState task branch will be named action-state.

## Some helpful git commands
- First, navigate to where you cloned the project to (For example In Documents/Programming/CS3505/assignment8)
`cd /mnt/c/Users/gcpease/Documents/Programming/CS3505/assignment8` gcpease is the username I used to sign into computer. Replace it with yours. Please hit the tab key a few times to see autocomplete options.

- To create a new branch, type in
`git branch <branch-name>` where <branch-name> follows the naming conventions.

- To start working in a different branch, type in
  `git checkout <branch-name>`
  
## Other important information
  - Do not push directly to main. At all, please.
  - Please run this command: `git config --global core.autocrlf true` it will prevent line endings screwing everything.
